In this project, I developed a comprehensive HR dashboard to help visualize and analyze employee data for GenTech.
Through this project demonstrates my ability to translate raw HR data into actionable insights using Excel's advanced features, focusing on data integrity, clarity, and interactivity.

### Data Preprocessing
The process began with cleaning and transforming raw employee records, ensuring consistency in salary formats, role titles, and department categorization.
I applied lookup functions (e.g., VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH) to cross-reference data such as department codes and training categories, and used conditional logic (e.g., IF, IFS) to flag missing or incorrect entries.

### Data Exploration & Analysis
Once the dataset was clean, I performed data summarization to extract meaningful insights. This involved calculating average salaries by both department and role, aggregating the number of employees per training category, and analyzing average years of experience across job roles.
I used PivotTables to dynamically group and filter the data, and incorporated slicers for interactive filtering by department, role, and training type.

### Data Visualization
The final output is a visually engaging and functional Excel dashboard, designed to help HR decision-makers quickly identify trends such as:  
- Which departments or roles offer the highest salaries
- Which training categories are most utilized
- How experience varies across job functions.

### Insight and Decision-Making Conclusion
The dashboard reveals that **Marketing** has the highest average salary among departments, while **Content Creator** roles lead in pay across all job titles.
Meanwhile, **Technical Tools** and **Project Management** are the most pursued training categories, suggesting high demand for technical upskilling.
Roles like **Technician** and **Financial Analyst** show the longest average tenure, which may reflect job stability or slower career progression.
These insights can guide strategic HR actions, such as:
- **Salary adjustments** in underpaid departments to improve equity.
- **Targeted training programs** for departments with lower experience or performance.
- **Career development planning** for roles with long tenures but limited growth.
